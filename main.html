	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity means that the memory consumption grows linearly with the size of the input O(n).</p>
