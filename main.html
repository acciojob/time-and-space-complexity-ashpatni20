	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity refers to the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. It is an essential measure to analyze and compare how efficient algorithms are, helping determine how well they will scale with larger inputs should be more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity means that the memory consumption grows linearly with the size of the input O(n).</p>
